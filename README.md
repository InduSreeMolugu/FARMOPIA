Agriculture is the primary mainstay of the economy in our country. In recent years because of 
uncertain trends in climate and other fluctuations in the price trends, the price of the crop has 
varied to a larger level. Farmers remain oblivious to these uncertainties, which spoil the crops 
and cause massive losses. Even if they are aware of the crop type which would benefit them most, 
sometimes due to their limited knowledge of different crop diseases and their specific remedies, crops get 
damaged. This application is handy and easy to use. It provides accurate results in predicting the price 
of the crop. This framework utilizes Machine Learningâ€™s Decision Tree Regression Algorithm 
to predict crop price. The attributes considered for prediction are rainfall, wholesale price index, 
month, and year. Consequently, the system gives an advance forecast to the farmers' which 
grows the speed of profit to them and consequently the country's economy. This application also 
incorporates other modules like weather forecast, crop recommendation, fertilizer 
recommendation, shop, chat portal, and guide are also implemented.
